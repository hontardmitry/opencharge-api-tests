== Vehicle Plug-in ==
Driver -> Charger: Plug vehicle

== Authentication ==
Driver -> App: Initiate charging
App -> CMS: POST Authentication request {userID, chargerID, authToken}
CMS -> Auth: Verify user credentials
Auth --> CMS: Auth success
CMS --> Charger: Charging approved

== Station Communication (OCPP) ==
Charger -> CMS: OCPP start charging request
note right of Charger
Uses OCPP protocol to communicate
with backend management system
end note

== Energy Optimization ==
CMS -> Energy: Evaluate optimal charging rate
note right of Energy
Considers grid load, user plan,
charger type (AC/DC/MCS)
end note
Energy --> CMS: Optimal charging rate {rate: 50kW}

== Charging Starts ==
CMS -> Charger: OCPP start charging configuration {rate: 50kW}
Charger -> Vehicle: Start charging using configuration {rate: 50kW}

== Status Update ==
CMS -> App: POST charging session status
App -> Driver: Charging in progress (50kW)
